### 1. The Legacy and Valuation of the Los Angeles Lakers

17 championships, a team currently worth $7.1 Billion in value, and a legacy of countless iconic players – The Los Angeles Lakers are undisputedly recognized as one of the most storied franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. Before the Lakers came the Detroit Gems, founded in 1946. They moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota the subsequent year, then finally to Los Angeles ahead of the 1906-61 season after a spell of financial and performance troubles, where they have remained as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference ever since (Augustyn). Over its 77 season history, the Lakers’ has housed some of the NBA’s greatest legends, including Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Kobe Byrant to name a few. Such stars brought about many eras of triumph, establishing the west coast team not only as a dominant force on the court, but also as a distinguished international brand loved by fans around the globe.
The Lakers' consistent success and "Hollywood" appeal contribute to their substantial year-on-year valuation growth. Situated in Los Angeles, with its affluent population and status as the entertainment capital, the team regularly draws celebrities and high-net-worth individuals to the Crypto.com Arena. This allows them to charge premium ticket prices, secure lucrative sponsorships, and maintain a significant impact on basketball culture (Ozzy's Collectible Hub). Although the Buss family – owners of the Lakers – may not boast the greatest financial resources, the purple-and-yellow outfit’s brand alone grants them a truly unique position in the industry; one that very few teams can rival, particularly in terms of commercial partnerships and merchandise sales (Pincus).

2018 marked a pivotal moment for the Lakers as they signed 4-time MVP winner LeBron James to a 4-Year $154 Million Deal in a bid to end one of the most unsuccessful periods in their history (Stein and Cacciola). Since the 4-time champion’s arrival, the Lakers have reported intense ticket demand. James Peltz of the L.A. Times reported that “The lowest price of a Lakers season ticket for Staples Center [now Crypto.com Arena] games jumped to $5,750 from $3,499 on StubHub.com, while the high end reached nearly $100,000”. James’ influence also extends to merchandise sales; Jack Boyle, co-president of the direct-to-consumer business at Fanatics, disclosed that LeBron’s Lakers jersey set a new single-day record in dollar sales for an NBA player joining a new team as a free agent or by a trade (Peltz). Even though COVID-19 caused operating income and revenue to stagnate between 2020-2021, the Lakers’ valuation has always remained on an upwards trajectory, as seen in Figure 1 below. A report published by Forbes recorded a positive 11% value change between 2023 and 2024, as substantiated by revenues totalling $552 million and an operating income of $199 million (Teitelbaum and Knight). It’s no surprise to see the Lakers being ranked among the highest-valued NBA franchises, thanks to its robust combination of revenue sources. But with the game’s biggest star on board, the Lakers have taken their marketability to another level, creating a financial profile that is profitable and positioned for sustained growth. Having re-signed once in 2022 and again in 2024, only time will tell what more James and the Lakers can achieve.
